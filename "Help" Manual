Manual Help Command
===================================================================================
Implementation:This plugin provides help on the given command by accessing the text string in the comment section of the corresponding source file predefined by the developer.In more geeral sense,it is basically a source code parser which filters out the necessary detail for the command defined by the developer and prints it on the interpreter for help purposes from the source file of that command.

Plugin Coding Standard:To allow help command to access the help manual defined in comment section in the source code of a command,developer must write the help manual between a start tag and an end tag.
Start tag is "<Plugin Manual>".The help string should start from the next line of the start tag and terminated by an end tag which is "<End>".All the information apperaing for the command within these two tags will be printed on the interpreter upon user's request.

Usage:
Syntax:help [command]

Example:
gnucap> help
Usage: help [command]

To get help on the "version" command,execute following and let us see what version command does.

gnucap> help version
Purpose:Prints the version of gnucap being used
Usage:version
Comments:'ver' also works.
Example:
gnucap> version
Gnucap Version: 2009.12.07 RCS 26.136

Help Version 2
===========================================
Plugin Coding Standard:
1.Define a static helptext variable of string type in the anonymous namespace.Initialise the help string with the manual for your command.
Ex.:static std::string helptext = "help manual";
2.Include an if statement in your plugin which runs if the argument is --help.
Ex.:
class CMD_VERSION : public CMD {
public:
  void do_it(CS& cmd, CARD_LIST*) {itested();
	 if(cmd.tail() == "--help"){
			IO::mstdout << helptext;//
	 }else{
     	//Your plugin
	 }
  }
}p;
DISPATCHER<CMD>::INSTALL d(&command_dispatcher,"version|ver",&p);
}

The "if" portion in help command is a kinf of headache.Next update for this command will consider this and it will accomodate help_dispatcher.
