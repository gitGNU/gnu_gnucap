Using the model compiler</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section is a first cut at documentation.  If you actually want to
install a model, please ask for more information.  Your questions will
help me write the more complete documentation.  (aldavis@ieee.org)

<P>
To create a model using this method, you create one file, with the
extension <TT>.model</TT>.  A separate program, <TT>modelgen</TT> processes
this file to generate the appropriate <TT>.cc</TT> and <TT>.h</TT> files.
The resulting files are equivalent to the subcircuit method of
creating models.

<P>
There are two primary sections, <TT>device</TT> and <TT>model</TT>.  Most
models have both, but a device can use several different <TT>model</TT>s
as long as they are derived from a common base and designed to work
together.  It is standard practice to share like this.  For example,
all of the MOS models use the same <TT>device</TT> section.

<P>
Any <TT>model</TT> can inherit from another <TT>model</TT>, thus reducing
the need for repetition when code or parameters are the same in
different models, and allowing several to use the same <TT>device</TT>
section.

<P>
This model compiler has restrictions that will be removed in future
releases.  Not all device types can be fully done with it, due to
missing features.  Often, it is necessary to finish the job manually.
In this release (0.30), the diode fully uses it, but not the way I
want to.  The MOSFET uses the <TT>cc_direct</TT> to finish the job.  Two
functions <TT>do_tr</TT> and <TT>tr_needs_eval</TT> must be provided this
way.  Code placed here is simply copied out.

<P>
As a general rule, when using the name = value form, the value is
delimited by whitespace, or possibly other tokens.  If you want blanks
in the value string, put it in quotes.  It is recommended to quote any
value string that is comprised of more than one word, even if there
are no blanks.

</DL>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00711100000000000000">
Circuit subsection</A>
</H3>

<P>
The circuit subsection has 5 parts, in order.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The optional keyword ``<TT>sync</TT>'' says that the entire subcircuit
representing the device must be evaluated synchronously.  Without this
keyword, it is treated as a subcircuit made of independent elements.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The port list ``<TT>ports</TT>'', which is a list of the nodes
interfacing to the outside.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A list of local internal nodes, not visible outside.

<P>
Each local node may have two optional attributes:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>short_if</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies a conditional which if true will result in this node
being omitted.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>short_to</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies another node which will be substituted for this node if
the <TT>short_if</TT> condition is true.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Any number of named and typed <TT>args</TT> sections.  Each section
contains name = value pairs which assign values to elements in the
subcircuit.  It is used only for more complex elements like diodes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A list of circuit elements that comprise the model.  Each has three
required fields, then a list of optional key = value pairs.

<P>
The required fields, in order, are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The type of element.  This is usually one of resistance, capacitance,
admittance, or poly_g, but can be any device type, including those
created by modelgen.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The label, a string used to refer to it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A node list, in curly braces.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
After that, optional fields are used to assign attributes.  Not all
are legal or appropriate with all element types.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>value</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This must evaluate to a constant, which is interpreted as the nominal
value of the element.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>eval</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the name of an <TT>eval</TT> section, which specifies nonlinear,
and depenndent characteristics.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>args</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This refers to an <TT>args</TT> section, described previously.  It is
used only for advanced element types, as those created by modelgen.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>reverse</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies an expression, that when evaluated will tell whether to
reverse the element.  If it evaluates to true, the node pairs are
interchanged.  If there are two nodes, they are interchanged.  If
there are four, the first pair are interchanged and the second pair
are interchanges.  The pattern repeats for as many nodes as there are.
This is used with diodes, which may be reversed depending on whether
the device being defined is N-type or P-type.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>omit</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies an expression, that when evaluated will tell whether to
omit the element.  If it evaluates to true, the element is omitted.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>state</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This specifies a the name of a device state variable that is applied
to this element.  This state variable must be one of those defined
under <TT>calculated parameters</TT>.  It is primarily intended for the
<TT>poly_g</TT> and <TT>poly_cap</TT> element types.  In the <TT>calculated
parameters</TT> section, the following parameters are its derivatives.  If
the poly element has N node pairs, the following N parameters are the
derivatives, with respect to each voltage, in order.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00711200000000000000">
Tr_probe subsection</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>tr_probe</TT> subsection is where you list the probes for
transient and DC analysis.  It is a list of name = value pairs, where
the value is an expression that calculates or looks up the value.

<P>
You can reference any device parameter directly, or others with the
appropriate struct prefixing.

<P>
You can reference probes on internal elements with the syntax ``<TT>@</TT>'', followed by the element label, followed by the probe name in
square brackets.  For example, ``<TT>@Cj[Capacitance]</TT>'' refers to
the probe named ``Capacitance'' on the element ``Cj''.  It is your
responsibility to see that the element actually exists, and that it
has a probe with that name.

<P>
You can reference node voltages with the same syntax, but the
``device'' name is formed by prefixing the node name with ``<TT>n_</TT>''.

<P>
You can also call functions, and make arbitrary expressions.  In
general, the code is just copied over, with the exception of the
probes, which are modified to the internal format.

<P>
The probe name in the generated model will be non-case-sensitive.  To
the model compiler, upper case letters must match exactly, and lower
case letters are optional.  For example, ``<TT>CGSOvl</TT>'' in the model
file can be referred to as <TT>cgso</TT>, <TT>cgsov</TT>, or <TT>cgsovl</TT>,
or any variants differing only in case.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00711300000000000000">

</H3>

<P>
In this release, this section is a dummy.  Put a stub here if you

in a future release.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00711600000000000000">
Evaluators</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <TT>eval</TT> sections are evaluators that turn the primitive
resistors and capacitors into advanced behavioral elements.

<P>
The body is the core of a C++ function, which is copied over directly
after attaching some headers.  Given some ``x'', this function
computes ``f(x)'' and its derivative with respect to x.  The primary
communication is through the structure ``<TT>d-&gt;_y0</TT>''.  The input is
``<TT>d-&gt;_y0.x</TT>''.  You must evaluate the function, and place the
result in ``<TT>d-&gt;_y0.f0</TT>'' and its derivative in ``<TT>d-&gt;_y0.f1</TT>''.  The exact meaning of these values depends on what type
of element it is.

<P>
For the primitives ...

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>resistance</STRONG></DT>
<DD>x is current, y0 is voltage, y1 is resistance

<P>
The format for each item is: type, name, comment, attributes, semicolon.

<P>
The available attributes are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>name</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the name to be used for input in the data file.  It is also
the name this parameter is listed as when the internal data is
printed.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>alt_name</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is an alternate name used for input.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>default</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the initial default value, set by the constructor.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>calculate</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>If no value is supplied, the program will calculate it using this
formula.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>quiet_min</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the input or calculated value is less than this number, substitute
this number without warning.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>quiet_max</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>If the input or calculated value is more than this number, substitute
this number without warning.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>final_default</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the final default value, supplied after all attempts to fill
or calculate it fail.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>offset</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Add this number to the input value to get the value actually stored in
memory.  Example: <TT>double temperature ``'' offset=273;</TT>.  This
sample allows data entry in degrees Celsius, but storage in Kelvin.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>scale</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Multiply the input value by this number to get the value actually
stored in memory.  Example: <TT>double length ``'' offset=1e6;</TT>.
This sample allows data entry in microns, but storage in meters.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>positive</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This number is always positive.  The magnitude of the entered value is
stored.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>octal</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>The number read is interpreted as octal (base 8), instead of the usual
base 10.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>print_test</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a test to determine whether the value is printed in a standard
listing or not.  The value is printed only if this test evaluates to
true at run time.  If <TT>print_test</TT> is omitted, it is always
printed.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>calc_print_test</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a test to determine whether the value is printed as a comment
in a standard listing or not.  The value is printed only if this test
