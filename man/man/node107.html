<H2><A NAME="SECTION00821000000000000000">
The ``CPOLY'' and ``FPOLY'' classes</A>
</H2>

<P>
Before beginning a discussion of the evaluation and stamp methods, it
is necessary to understand the ``CPOLY'' and ``FPOLY'' classes.

<P>
These classes represent polynomials.  At present, only the first order
versions are used, but consider that they could be extended to any
order.

<P>
When evaluating a function <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img48.png"
 ALT="$f(x)$">, there are several possible
representations for the result.  The ``CPOLY'' and ``FPOLY'' represent
two of them.

<P>
The ``CPOLY'' classes represent the result in a traditional polynomial
form.  Consider a series of terms, c0, c1, c2, ...  These represent
the coefficients of a Taylor series of the function expanded about 0.
(Maclauran series).  Thus <!-- MATH
 $f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 +
...$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="245" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img49.png"
 ALT="$f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 +
... $"> In most cases, only the c0 and c1 terms are used, hence the
``CPOLY1'' class.  The series is truncated, so it is exact only at one
point.  The value ``x'' in the ``CPOLY'' class is the point at which
the truncated series is exact, so it is not truly a series expanded
about 0.

<P>
The other ``FPOLY'' classes represent the same polynomial as a Taylor
series expanded about a point ``x''.  Again, consider a series of
terms, f0, f1, f2, ...  This time the terms represent the function
evaluated at x and its derivatives.  Therefore, f0 is <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img48.png"
 ALT="$f(x)$">, f1 is
the first derivative, f2 is the second derivative, and so on.  To
evaluate this for some <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img50.png"
 ALT="$t$"> near <IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img51.png"
 ALT="$x$">, <!-- MATH
 $f(t) = f_0 + f_1 (t-x) + f_2
(t-x)^2 + f_3 (t-x)^3 + ...$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img52.png"
 ALT="$f(t) = f_0 + f_1 (t-x) + f_2
(t-x)^2 + f_3 (t-x)^3 + ... $"> Again, in most cases, only the f0 and f1
terms are used, hence the ``FPOLY1'' class.

<P>
Both of these are equivalent in the sense that they represent the same
data, and there are functions (constructors) that convert between
them.  The ``FPOLY'' form is usually most convenient for function
evaluation used in behavioral modeling and device modeling.  The
``CPOLY'' form is most suitable for stamping into the admittance
matrix and current vector for the final solution.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00822000000000000000">
The basic solution algorithm</A>
</H2>

<P>
In simplified form, the algorithm looks like this ...

<P>
before doing anything ....
<PRE>
  expand()
  precalc()
</PRE>

<P>
on issuing the ``tran'' command ..
<PRE>
tr_begin() // get ready
for (each time step) {
  tr_advance() // precalculate and propagate
  for (each iteration) {
    tr_queue_eval() // decide which models need evaluating
    do_tr() // evaluate models
    tr_load() // build the matrix of equations
    solve the resulting system of equations
  }
  if (converged) {
    tr_review() // how are we doing? suggest time step
  }
  if (no problems) {
    tr_accept() // postcalculate and accept data
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
The functions referred to above are actually loops that call that
function for all devices in the circuit.

<P>
For all of them, it is possible that they may not be called.  If there
is evidence that the result will not change from the last time it was
called, it probably will not be called.  Since this algorithm is not
perfect, it is possible that any particular function may be called
twice, so they are written so calling more than once is equivalent to
calling once.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822100000000000000">
expand</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <EM>expand</EM> functions expand subcircuits and models, as needed.
Unlike Spice, it does not flatten the circuit.  It allocates space for
the additional storage, attaches models, and related tasks.  It does
not compute any values.  It is called once after reading the circuit,
and possibly later when the topology of the circuit is changed.

<P>
Most simple elements do not have expand functions.  Most advanced
components do.

<P>
Expanding a subcircuit makes a copy of it, and remaps the nodes.  Most
components use a shallow copy.  That is, if something is attached
through a pointer, the value of the pointer is copied, not the
attachment.  Commons are never copied when the owner components are
copied. 

<P>
It is ok to expand a component more than once.  Either it frees then
re-expands, or it keeps what it can and checks to make sure it is
correct. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822200000000000000">
precalc</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <EM>precalc</EM> functions attempt to pre-calculate anything that
will remain constant during a simulation run.  This includes size
dependent transistor parameters and the stamp values for linear
elements.

<P>
The actual evaluation of constant linear elements is done here.  For
nonlinear elements, it computes a first guess.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822300000000000000">
dc_begin, tr_begin, tr_restore</A>
</H3>

<P>
These functions are called once on issuing a simulation command.  The
<EM>dc_begin</EM> functions are called on starting a DC or OP anaylsis.
The <EM>tr_begin</EM> functions are called on starting a transient
analysis from time = 0, or the first time.  The <EM>tr_restore</EM>
functions are called on starting a transient analysis in such a way
that the analysis continues from where a previous transient analysis
left off.

<P>
The purpose is to make sure that the initial guesses and numbers for
prior iterations that don't exist are properly set up.  For linear
elements, the values are set up here and are not computed later.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822400000000000000">
dc_advance, tr_advance</A>
</H3>

<P>
These functions are called before beginning a new time or voltage
step.

<P>
For basic storage elements like capacitors, they store the data from
the previous step.  They may also attempt to predict a new value, in
hopes of speeding up the real solution.

<P>
For delay elements like logic devices and transmission lines, this
function does the real work.  It takes previous results and applies
them, generating data that will be later loaded into the matrix.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822500000000000000">
tr_needs_eval</A>
</H3>

<P>
This function returns true if the component needs to be evaluated on
this iteration.  It should return false if it has already been queued,
but some do not do this.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822600000000000000">
tr_queue_eval</A>
</H3>

<P>
This function queues the component to be evaluated, if it needs it.
If <EM>tr_queue_eval</EM> is not called, it will not be evaluated.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822700000000000000">
do_tr</A>
</H3>

<P>
In most cases, the <EM>do_tr</EM> functions do the real work, or call
the <EM>tr_eval</EM> function to do it.  It evaluates the model, checks
convergence, and queues it for loading.  Calling this function more
than once on an iteration is harmless, except for the waste of time.

<P>
Usually, it calculates the function and derivative.  It may also do
integration, interpolation, iteration, or whatever is required.  The
result is a set of values ready to stamp into the admittance matrix
and current vector.

<P>
There are several distinct steps within this function.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The first step is to gather the information necessary to make
the computations.  Usually, this is the node voltages, but it could be 
currents, temperature, charge, or something else.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The next step is to evaluate any attached function.  This could
be done in line, or by a call to <EM>tr_eval</EM>.  The result of this
evaluation is stored in <EM>_y0</EM> (of type <EM>FPOLY1</EM>.  The <EM>tr_eval</EM> 
function reads the value of <EM>x</EM> from <EM>_y0</EM>, and fills in the
<EM>f0</EM> with the result of function evaluation, and <EM>f1</EM> with its 
derivative.  The <EM>tr_eval</EM> function must also check for
convergence by comparing the new <EM>_y0</EM> with the old value, <EM>_y1</EM>.  This attached function is generic in the sense that it is the
same for all device types.  This is the <IMG
 WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img53.png"
 ALT="$y = f(x)$"> that is referred to 
in the behavioral modeling documentation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>These values are stored for convergence checking and probing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>After that, it must be converted to a current and admittance so
it can be used in the system of nodal equations.  This step is
dependent on what type of device it is.  For a conductance element,
<EM>tr_eval</EM> directly returns the correct information, so nothing
needs to be done here.  For a capacitor, this step does numerical
integration.  Capacitors store this in <EM>_i0</EM>.  Most other elements 
do not store this result directly.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Then, it must be converted into <EM>CPOLY</EM> form to meet the
requirements of the system of equations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The device is queued for loading.  Unlike Spice, GnuCap does not
actually load the matrix here.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822800000000000000">
tr_load</A>
</H3>

<P>
This function gives the appearance of loading the admittance matrix
and current vector with the values calculated in <EM>do_tr</EM>.

<P>
Actually, it does much more.  In most cases, it actually loads a
correction factor, assuming the old values are already loaded.  To do
this, it keeps track of what values are actually loaded.  Whether it
loads a correction or the actual value is determined first by the
option <EM>incmode</EM>, then by status information about the solution.
If it is suspected that correcting would cause too much roundoff
error, it loads the actual value.  The decision of whether to do a
full load or an update is global.

<P>
In addition, it may apply damping in hopes of improving convergence.
This means to load a value somewhere between the new and old values,
in effect taking a partial step.  The decision to damp is semi-global.
Groups of elements are adjusted together.

<P>
The actual loading is done by one or more of a small group of general
functions, depending on whether the element is active, passive, poly,
or a source.  Only certain patterns can be stamped.  Complex devices
use a combination of these patterns.

<P>
WARNING to model developers:  DO NOT stamp the matrix directly!

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00822900000000000000">
tr_review</A>
</H3>

<P>
The <EM>tr_review</EM> function checks errors and signal conditions
after a time step has converged.  It makes entries into the event
queue, makes mode decisions for mixed-mode simulation, and evaluates
time step dependent errors.  It returns an approximate time that the
element wants for the next step.  The actual next time step will
probably be sooner than the value returned.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION008221000000000000000">
tr_accept</A>
</H3>

<P>
This function is called after the solution at a time step has been
accepted.  For most devices, it does nothing.  For devices having
storage and delayed propagation, it evaluates what signal will be
propagated.  For a transmission line, it calculates and sends on the
reflections.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION008221100000000000000">
tr_unload</A>
</H3>

<P>
This function removes the component from the matrix, possibly by
subtracting off what was loaded.  Usually, it sets the current values
to 0 and calls <EM>tr_load</EM>.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00823000000000000000">
Step control</A>
</H2>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00823100000000000000">
The basic algorithm</A>
</H3>

<P>
The basis of it is in the files ``s_tr_swp.cc'' and ``s_tr_rev.cc''.

<P>
The function TRANSIENT::review sets two variables: ``approxtime'' and
``control''.

<P>
The variable ``approxtime'' is a suggestion of what the next time
should be.  Note that this is a time, not a difference.  Also note
that the simulator may override this suggestion.  Another ``control''
is an enum that shows how the time was selected.  You can probe
control(0) to find this code, or control(1) to see how many steps (not
iterations) it calculated internally.

<P>
This time may be in the future, past, or again at the present time,
depending on conditions.  A time in the future means all is well, and
the simulation can proceed as expected.  A time in the past indicates
something is wrong, such as convergence failure, excessive truncation
error, or a missed event.  In this case, the step is rejected, and
time backed up.  A repeat at the present time usually means a latency
check failed.  A portion of the circuit that was thought to be latent
was found to be active.  This usually indicates a model problem.

<P>
First, it attempts to suggest a time ``rtime'' based on iteration count
and options.

<P>
There are several ``options'' that control the stepping:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>iterations <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$&gt;$"> itl4 ... reduce by option "trstepshrink".

<P>
</LI>
<LI>iterations <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$&gt;$"> itl3 ... suggest the same step as last time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>else (iterations <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img54.png"
 ALT="$&lt;=$"> itl3) ... increase step size.  Try the
max as per userstepsize/skip limit to larger of (rdt*trstepgrow) where
``rdt'' is the old ``review'' estimate or (oldstep*trstepgrow) where
oldstep is what was actually used last time and trstepgrow is an
option, from the options command.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Second it makes another suggestion ``tetime'' based on truncation
error, etc.  It does this by calling the ``review'' function for all
components, and taking the minimum.  Any component can suggest a time
for its next evaluation with its review function.  Most components
return a very large number, letting the capacitors and inductors
dominate, but it is not required for it to be so.  This time should be
in the future, but errors could produce a time in the past.

<P>
Then, the earliest time of the above two methods is selected.  A time
in the past means to reject the most recent time step and back up, but
note that this time is only a suggestion that may not be used.

<P>
The function ``TRANSIENT::sweep'' essentially processes the loop ``for
(first(); notpastend; next())''.  The function ``TRANSIENT::next()''
actually advances (hopefully) to the next step.  It may go backwards.

<P>
The actual time step depends on the suggestion by the review function
(approxtime), the event queue (which includes what Spice calls
``breakpoints''), the user step size (nexttick), and some tricks to
minimize changes.

<P>
Some considerations ...

<UL>
<LI>Changing the step size is an expensive operation, because it
usually forces a full LU decomposition and matrix reload.  If the step
can be kept constant, changes are limited to the right-side,
eliminating the need for the full evaluation and LU.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The simulator will place a time step exactly at any step for
which the user has requested output, or Fourier analysis needs a
point, or at any event from the event queue.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
So, here it is ...

<P>
Assume we want it at the time the user requested.  If the event queue
says to do it sooner, take it, else take the user time.  Note that
this time is needed exactly, either now or later.  If the
``approxtime'' is sooner than the exact time, inject a time step as
follows...  if the time step is less than half of the time to when an
exact time is needed, take the approxtime, else take half of the
exact interval, in hopes that the next step will use up the other
half.

<P>
After that, there are some checks ....

<P>
``Very backward time step'' means that the suggested new step is
earlier than the PREVIOUS step, meaning that both the current step and
its predecessor are rejected, thus it should back up two steps.  Since
it can back up only one step, it rejects the most recent step and
tries again at the minimum step size.  This usually means there is a
bug in the software.

<P>
``Backwards time step'' means to reject the most recent step, but the
one before that is ok.  It will reject the step and try again at the
smaller interval.  This happens fairly often, usually due to slow
convergence.

<P>
``Zero time step'' means that the new time is the same as the previous
time, which usually means there is a bug in the software.  Something
is requesting a re-evaluation at the same time.

<P>
The combination of ``zero time step'' and ``very backward time step''
means that the re-evaluation didn't work.

<P>
Now, accept the new time and proceed.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00823200000000000000">
The ``review'' function</A>
</H3>

<P>
Every component can have a ``review'' function, in which it can
determine whether to accept or reject the solution.  It will accept by
suggesting a time in the future, or reject by suggesting a time in the
past.  It returns the suggested time.  It can call new_event to
request an exact time.

<P>
For capacitors and inductors, the review function attempts to estimate
truncation error using a divided difference method, and it suggests a
time for the next solution that will result in meeting the error
requirement.  Occasionally, it will discover that the step just
computed fails to meet the requirement, so it will reject it.

<P>
Truncation error is related to the third derivative of charge or flux.
Since current is the first derivative of charge, it would seem that
second derivative of current should produce the same results faster.
In practice, the current based method tends to estimate high leading
to smaller steps, and the charge based method tends to estimate low,
leading to larger steps.  The conservative approach would suggest
using the current based method, but that sometimes led to unreasonably
small steps ans slow simulations, so I chose (as Spice did) the other
method.  Either method is ok when the step size used is close to being
reasonable, but when the trial step is unreasonably large, either
approach gives a very poor estimate.  Taking a step much too small
will make the simulator run much slower, as it takes many steps, then
the step size is allowed to grow slowly.  This is slower both because
of the many unnecessary steps, and because of many adjustments.
Taking a step that is much too large will result in a choice that is
better than the first trial, which will make a better estimate and be
rejected.  It is rare to get more than one rejection based on
truncation error.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00823300000000000000">
Conclusion</A>
</H3>

<P>
GnuCap will usually do more time steps than Spice will, due to 2 factors.
GnuCap will force calculations at print points and fourier points, and
can reject a bad step.  It is usually a little more, but could be as
much as twice as many steps.
