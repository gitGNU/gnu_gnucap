If that doesn't work</A>

<P>
This version requires a two-step build.  First you build the model
compiler, then you build the simulator.  You can usually get away with
only building the simulator.

<P>
So ..
cd to modelgen, type make (as below)
then go back down and cd to src, type make (as below)

<P>
If it fails, go into its build directory (the one containing the .o
files) and manually create a symbolic link to the model compiler.

<P>
"Type make" really means ......

<P>
Usually, you can just type "make".  This will make a "release"
version, with optimization on and extra debug code out.  It will build
in the O subdirectory.  This assumes you have g++ in a reasonable
configuration.

<P>
To make a "debug" version (slow, with additional error checking), type
"make debug".  If you have a recent g++ compiler, this should build it
in the O-DEBUG subdirectory.

<P>
If your compiler is not g=++, but called by "CC", try "make CC".  This
is believed to work with some compilers.  Some of them do not
implement the full language, so they cannot be used.  Try it.  There
is a special one "sun4-CC" for a Sun running Solaris with the most
recent version of Sun's compiler.  It will not work with older
versions.

<P>
To make a "release" version for a particular system, type make
followed by your system type, such as "make linux".  This will build
it in a subdirectory (in this case LINUX).  With this method, you can
build for multiple systems in the same directory.

<P>
Look at "Makefile" for a list of supported systems, and clues of how
to do it on others.  Most of them have not been tried in years.

<P>
If it doesn't work, edit only a "Make2.*" file, and possibly <TT>md.h</TT> or
<TT>md.cc</TT>.  All nonportabilities are confined to these files.

<P>
It does require a recent and proper C++ compiler with a proper
library, including STL.  Gnu compilers older than 2.8 will probably
not work.  Anything else that old will also probably not work.  Any
high quality C++ compiler available today should work.

<P>
To install ....

<P>
Just move or copy the executable to where you want it.

<P>
