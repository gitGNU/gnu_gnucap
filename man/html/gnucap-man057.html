<A NAME="@default277"></A>
<A NAME="@default278"></A>

<H3>2.46.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax</H3>

<TT>UNMark</TT>


<H3>2.46.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</H3>
Forget remembered circuit voltages and currents. Undo the `<TT>mark</TT>'
command.

<H3>2.46.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments</H3>
Allow time to proceed. It has been held back by the `<TT>mark</TT>' command.

<H3>2.46.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples</H3>
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT>
<B><TT>transient 0 1 .01</TT></B><DD> A transient analysis starting at zero,
running until 1 second, with step size .01 seconds. After this run, the
clock is at 1 second.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>mark</TT></B><DD> Remember the time, voltages, currents, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> Another transient analysis. It continues from 1
second, to 2 seconds. (It spans 1 second, as before.) This command was not
affected by the <TT>mark</TT> command.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> This will do exactly the same as the last one. From
1 second to 2 seconds. If it were not for <TT>mark</TT>, it would have started
from 2 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient 1.5 .001</TT></B><DD> Try again with smaller steps. Again, it
starts at 1 second.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>unmark</TT></B><DD> Release the effect of <TT>mark</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> Exactly the same as the last time, as if we didn't
<TT>unmark</TT>. (1 to 1.5 seconds.)<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> This one continues from where the last one left off:
at 1.5 seconds. From now on, time will move forward.</DL>
