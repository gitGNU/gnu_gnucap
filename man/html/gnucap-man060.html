<H2><A NAME="htoc59">3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</H2>
To describe a circuit, you must provide a `netlist'. The netlist is simply
a list of the components with their connections and values. The format is
essentially the same as the standard SPICE format.<BR>
<BR>
Before doing this, number the nodes on your schematic. (A node is a place
where parts connect together.) Then, each part gets a line in the netlist
(circuit description). In its simplest form, which you will use most of the
time, it is just the type, such as `R' for resistor, or a label, like `R47',
followed by the two nodes it connects to, then its value.<BR>
<BR>
Example: `<TT>R29 6 8 22k</TT>' is a 22k resistor between nodes 6 and 8.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="@default285"></A>
<A NAME="@default286"></A>
 Node 0 is used as a reference for all calculations and is assumed to have a
voltage of zero. (This is the ground, earth or common node.) Nodes must be
nonnegative integers, but need not be numbered sequentially.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="@default287"></A>
 There should be a DC path through the circuit to node 0 from every node
that is actually used. The circuit cannot contain a cutset of current
sources and/or capacitors. If either of these cases occurs, it will be
discovered during analysis. The program will attempt to correct the error,
issue an `open circuit' error message and continue. This is rarely a
problem with real circuits. Most circuits have such a path, however
indirect.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor devices require both a device statement, and a <TT>.model</TT>
statement (or ``card''). The device statement, described in the Circuit
description chapter, defines individual devices as variations from a
prototype, as is required for different devices on the same substrate. The
model statement, described in this chapter, defines process dependent
parameters, which usually apply to all devices on a substrate.<BR>
<BR>
The <TT>.model</TT> card syntax is:

<TT>.model</TT> <I>mname type</I> {<I>args</I>}
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Mname</I> is the model name, which elements will use to refer to this
model. <I>Type</I> is one of several types of built-in models. <I>Args</I>
is a list of the parameters, of the form <I>name</I><TT>=</TT><I>value</I>.
