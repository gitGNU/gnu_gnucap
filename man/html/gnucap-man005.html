<H2><A NAME="htoc4">1.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to use this manual</H2>
The best approach is to read this chapter, then read the command summary at
the beginning of chapter 2, then run the examples in the tutorial section.
Later, when you want to use the advanced features, go back for more detail.<BR>

This manual is designed as a reference for users who are familiar with
circuit design, and therefore does not present information on circuit design
but only on the use of this program to analyze such a design. Likewise, it
is not a text in modeling, although the models section does touch on it.<BR>
