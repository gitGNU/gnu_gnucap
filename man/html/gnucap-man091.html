<H2><A NAME="htoc90">4.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>GENERATOR</TT>: Signal Generator time dependent value</H2>

<H3>4.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax</H3>

<TT>GENERATOR</TT> <I>scale</I>


<H3>4.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</H3>
The component ``value'' is dependent on a ``signal generator'',
manipulated by the ``generator'' command.

<H3>4.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments</H3>
For transient analysis, the ``value'' is determined by a signal
generator, which is considered to be external to the circuit and part
of the test bench. See the ``generator'' command for more
information.<BR>
<BR>
For AC analysis, the value here is the amplitude.<BR>
<BR>
Strictly, all of the functionality and more is available through the
Spice-like behavioral modeling functions, but this one provides a user 
interface closer to the function generator that an analog designer
would use on a real bench. It is mainly used for interactive operation.<BR>
<BR>
It also provides backward compatibility with predecessors to Gnucap,
which used a different netlist format.
