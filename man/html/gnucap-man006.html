<A NAME="@default9"></A>
Commands are whole words, but usually you only have to type enough of the
word to make it unique. The first three letters will almost always work.
In some cases less will do. The whole word is significant, if used, and
must be spelled correctly.
<A NAME="@default10"></A>
<A NAME="@default11"></A><BR>
<BR>
In files, commands must be prefixed with a dot (.). This is done for
compatibility with other simulation programs, such as SPICE.<BR>
<BR>
Command options should be separated by commas or spaces. In some cases, the
commas or spaces are not necessary, but it is good practice to use them.<BR>
<BR>
Upper and lower case are usually the same.
<A NAME="@default12"></A>
<A NAME="@default13"></A>
<A NAME="@default14"></A><BR>
<BR>
Usually options can be entered in any order. The exceptions to this are
numeric parameters, where the order determines their meaning, and
command-like parameters, where they are executed in order. If parameters
conflict, the last takes precedence.
<A NAME="@default15"></A><BR>
<BR>
In general, standard numeric parameters, such as sweep limits, must be
entered first, before any options.<BR>
<BR>
Any line starting with <TT>*</TT> is considered a comment line, and is
ignored. Anything on any line following a quote is ignored. This is mainly
intended for files.
<A NAME="@default16"></A><BR>
<BR>
This program supports abbreviated notation for floating point numeric
entries. `K' means kilo, or `e3', etc. `M' and `m' mean milli, not mega
(for Spice compatibility). `Meg' means mega. Of course, it will also take
the standard scientific notation. Letters following values, without spaces,
are ignored.
<A NAME="@default17"></A><BR>

T = Tera = e12<BR>
G = Giga = e9<BR>
Meg = Mega = e6<BR>
K = Kilo = e3<BR>
m = milli = e-3<BR>
u = micro = e-6<BR>
n = nano = e-9<BR>
p = pico = e-12<BR>
f = femto = e-15
