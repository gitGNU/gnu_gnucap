<H2><A NAME="htoc36">2.26</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>MARK</TT> command</H2>
<A NAME="@default128"></A>
<A NAME="@default129"></A>

<H3>2.26.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax</H3>

<TT>MArk</TT>


<H3>2.26.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</H3>
Remember circuit voltages and currents.

<H3>2.26.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments</H3>
After the <TT>mark</TT> command, the <TT>transient</TT> and <TT>fourier</TT> analysis
will continue from the values that were kept by the <TT>mark</TT> command,
instead of progressing every time.<BR>
<BR>
This allows reruns from the same starting point, which may be at any time,
not necessarily 0.

<H3>2.26.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples</H3>
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT>
<B><TT>transient 0 1 .01</TT></B><DD> A transient analysis starting at zero,
running until 1 second, with step size .01 seconds. After this run, the
clock is at 1 second.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>mark</TT></B><DD> Remember the time, voltages, currents, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> Another transient analysis. It continues from 1
second, to 2 seconds. (It spans 1 second, as before.) This command was not
affected by the <TT>mark</TT> command.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> This will do exactly the same as the last one. From
1 second to 2 seconds. If it were not for <TT>mark</TT>, it would have started
from 2 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient 1.5 .001</TT></B><DD> Try again with smaller steps. Again, it
starts at 1 second.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>unmark</TT></B><DD> Release the effect of <TT>mark</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> Exactly the same as the last time, as if we didn't
<TT>unmark</TT>. (1 to 1.5 seconds.)<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B><TT>transient</TT></B><DD> This one continues from where the last one left off:
at 1.5 seconds. From now on, time will move forward.</DL>
