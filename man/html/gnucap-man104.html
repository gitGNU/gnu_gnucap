Gnucap has three distinct styles of adding models:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT>
<B>Model Compiler</B><DD> is the easiest way to add models, but the least
 flexible. The model compiler generates .cc and .h files using the
 <EM>enhanced subcircuit</EM> mode. It is possible to develop models
 with almost no knowledge of the simulator internals. In most cases,
 this is the preferred way. The standard MOSFET and diode models are
 done this way.
<DT><B>Enhanced subcircuit</B><DD> is less efficient than <EM>primitive</EM> but
 has other advantages that make it preferable to <EM>primitive</EM> when
 you can use it. The model is defined as a combination of equations
 and topology. The AC and pole-zero code is inherited from a base
 class, so you don't need to to it. You need to understand the
 simulator's internals, and it is not likely to be portable to other
 simulators.
<DT><B>Primitive</B><DD> should be used only when absolutely necessary. If it
 is done correctly, it will result in the fastest execution, but you
 need to do everything. It requires thorough knowledge of the
 simulator internals, including how Gnucap is different from other
 simulators. If you miss some of the details, it is possible that
 your model will work but slow down the simulator significantly.
 Most of the primitive devices (resistors, sources) are done this
 way. A few device types that have special considerations, like
 gates and transmission lines, are also done this way.
