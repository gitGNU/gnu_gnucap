\section{{\tt SAVE} command}

\index{file: save}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verse}
{\tt SAve} {\it filename} \{{\it options} ...\}
\end{verse}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Purpose}

Saves the circuit on the disk.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comments}

The file is in an ASCII format, so the list may be used as part of a
report.  It is believed to be compatible with other simulators such as 
Berkeley Spice to the extent that the capabilities are the same.  
Compatibility with commercial Spice derivatives may be a problem because
they all have proprietary extensions and are incompatible with each other.

If the file name specified already exists, the old file is deleted and
replaced by a new file of the same name, after asking you for permission.

You can save a part of a circuit.  See the {\tt list} command for more details.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Examples}

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt save works.ckt}] Save the circuit in the file {\tt
works.ckt}, in the current directory.

\item[{\tt save}] Save the circuit.  Since you did not specify a file name,
it will ask for one.

\item[{\tt save partof.ckt R*}] Save a partial circuit, just the
resistors, to the file {\tt partof.ckt}.  (See the {\tt List}
command.)

%%%\index{models: save}
%%%\item[{\tt save q2n2222.mod}] Save this as a model file {\tt q2n2222.mod},
%%%so it can be called as a macro-model later.  Note that model files must
%%%start with a letter, so plain 2n2222.mod would be impossible to call.

\item[{\tt save /client/sim/ckt/no33}] You can specify a path name.
