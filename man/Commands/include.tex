\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verse}
{\tt INClude} {\it filename}
\end{verse}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Purpose}

Gets an existing circuit or model file, adds it to what is already in memory.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comments}

The first comment line of the file being read is the new title, and replaces
the existing title.

Comments in the circuit file are stored, unless they start with {\tt *+} in
which case they are thrown away.

`Dot cards' are interpreted the same as they would have been had the
file been simply inserted in place.  This means they are used as
presets if this file is included from a ``get'', or run if it is
included from a ``$<$''.

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt include npn.mod}] Include the file {\tt npn.mod}.

\end{description}
