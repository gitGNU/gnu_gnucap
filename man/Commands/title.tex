%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verse}
{\tt TItle}\\
{\tt TItle} {\it a line of text}
\end{verse}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Purpose}

View and create the heading line for printouts and files.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comments}

There is a header line at the beginning of every file, to help you identify
it in the future.  This command sets up what it says.  It also sets up a
heading for printouts and graphs.

When you use the `{\tt get}' command to bring in a new circuit, it replaces the
title with the one in the file.  The `{\tt title}' command lets you change it,
for the next time it is written out.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Examples}

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt title This is a test.}] Sets the file heading to `{\tt This is a
test.}' In the future, all files written will have `{\tt This is a test.}'
as their first line.

\item[{\tt title}] Displays the file heading.  In this case, it prints `{\tt
This is a test.}'

\end{description}
