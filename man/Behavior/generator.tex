\section{{\tt GENERATOR}: Signal Generator time dependent value}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verse}
{\tt GENERATOR} {\it scale}
\end{verse}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Purpose}

The component ``value'' is dependent on a ``signal generator'',
manipulated by the ``generator'' command.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Comments}

For transient analysis, the ``value'' is determined by a signal
generator, which is considered to be external to the circuit and part
of the test bench.  See the ``generator'' command for more
information.

For AC analysis, the value here is the amplitude.

Strictly, all of the functionality and more is available through the
Spice-like behavioral modeling functions, but this one provides a user 
interface closer to the function generator that an analog designer
would use on a real bench.  It is mainly used for interactive operation.

It also provides backward compatibility with predecessors to Gnucap,
which used a different netlist format.
