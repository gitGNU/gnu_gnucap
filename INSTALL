Installation Instructions
*************************

This program does not use "autoconf" but rather uses a simple script
that provides a subset with a similar interface.

In most cases, you can do:
=======
./configure
make
sudo make install
=======

The scripts are recursive, so you can cd to any of the subdirectories
and do the same.

By default, it installs in /usr/local .  To change it, you can specify a prefix:

./configure --prefix=/usr/share

If you have already compiled it, you do not need to recompile to
change the install directory.  Just ./configure and make install.

Other targets:

"make clean" removes object files.

"make debug" builds a development version with additional debugging
code enabled.  It runs about 2x slower than the standard build.

"make depend" builds the files "Make.depend" which are used to decide
what to rebuild.  You need to do this only if you modify the code in a
way that changes what files are included by #include.

"make tags" builds cross reference files that can be used by some
editors, such as emacs, to navigate the code.

"make manifest" builds a list of the files included in a distribution.
