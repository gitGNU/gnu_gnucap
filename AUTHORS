Gnucap is primarily the work of Albert Davis (aldavis@gnu.org).	

Here is a list of some of the contributors who have contributed more
than a bug report:

    Dan McMahill - "autoconf" interface, NetBSD package
    Stuart Brorson - configuration mods
    Telford Tendys - documentation and convergence
    Simon Hoffe - Command line editing and history

These people have contributed by making packages, or enhancing other
systems to include or work with gnucap.  Their work isn't in this
file, but it is just as important.  These are the ones I know about.
There are many more.

    Dan McMahill - NetBSD package.
    Werner Hoch - RPM (Fedora) package
    Hamish Moffatt - Debian package
    Dmitry Nadezhin - "electric" interface
