Gnucap 0.35 release notes  (09/20/2006)

New features:

1. Named nodes.  (Extended beyond Spice compatibility)

2. Nested subcircuits.  (Spice compatibility)

3. Parameters.  ("param" statement, passing parameters to subcircuits)
Parameters are variables, so you can change them at any time.

4. MOS level 8 and 49 models.

5. DC sweeps can be nested, for now up to 4 deep.  (Beyond Spice
compatibility.)

6. Autoconf based build system. The old build system is still
available by running "configure.old".

7. Improvements to the transient analysis step control algorithm.

8. Improvements to the switch model, focusing on timing accuracy and
convergence.


Other changes:

1. C++ language standard corrections, so it compiles with gcc 4.1.


Bugs, limits, etc.

1. Some charge effects are still missing from BSIM models.  This will
be fixed along with Verilog-A support.

2. Parameters can reference other parameters, but expressions are not
supported yet.


Current work, in progress:

1. Verilog-AMS support.
